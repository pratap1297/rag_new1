## Application Overview: RAG System

### 1. Introduction

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System is a comprehensive enterprise solution designed to intelligently retrieve information from a vast knowledge base and generate coherent, contextually relevant responses. It acts as a central intelligence layer, enabling users to interact with unstructured data through natural language queries.

### 2. Core Functionality

At its heart, the RAG system performs two primary functions:

*   **Retrieval**: Efficiently searches and retrieves relevant document chunks from a vectorized knowledge base based on user queries.
*   **Generation**: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize the retrieved information into human-like, informative answers.

This combination ensures that responses are not only fluent but also grounded in factual data, mitigating issues like hallucination common in pure generative AI models.

### 3. Architecture Highlights

The system is built with a modular and scalable architecture, leveraging modern Python frameworks and libraries. Key architectural patterns include:

*   **Microservice-Oriented API**: A FastAPI-based API serves as the primary interface, allowing for flexible integration with various frontends and other systems.
*   **Dependency Injection**: A custom dependency injection container (`DependencyContainer`) manages component instantiation and relationships, promoting modularity and testability.
*   **Pluggable Processors**: The ingestion pipeline supports a `ProcessorRegistry` allowing for easy extension to new document types.
*   **Unified Error Handling**: A standardized error handling system (`UnifiedErrorHandling`) ensures consistent error reporting and robust operation.
*   **Managed Resources**: A `ResourceManager` and `ModelMemoryManager` are implemented to efficiently manage system resources, particularly for memory-intensive ML models, preventing leaks and optimizing performance.
*   **Stateful Conversation Management**: LangGraph is used to manage complex conversational flows, maintaining context and history across turns.

*   **`processors/`**: Contains specialized processors for different document types (e.g., `excel_processor.py`, `pdf_processor.py`, `servicenow_processor.py`), each handling content extraction unique to its format.

#### 4.4. Retrieval Engine (`rag_system/src/retrieval`)

*   **`query_engine.py`**: Processes user queries, performs vector searches, and orchestrates response generation using LLMs.
*   **`llm_client.py`**: Provides a unified interface for interacting with various Large Language Models (e.g., Groq, OpenAI, Azure).

*   **`progress_monitor.py`**: Provides real-time visualization of document ingestion progress within the UI.

### 5. Data Flow Overview

1.  **Ingestion**: Documents are uploaded (via API or folder monitor), processed by specialized processors, chunked, embedded into vectors, and stored in the vector store along with their metadata.
2.  **Query**: User queries are received via the API, enhanced, converted into vectors, used to search the vector store, and the retrieved context is fed to an LLM for response generation.
3.  **Conversation**: User messages update a LangGraph state, which orchestrates retrieval and generation steps, maintaining context and providing a conversational experience.

### 6. Future Enhancements

*   Integration with more external data sources (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence).
*   Advanced user management and access control.
*   Fine-tuning of LLMs for domain-specific knowledge.
*   More sophisticated feedback loops for continuous model improvement.
*   Scalability improvements for handling extremely large datasets and high query loads.
