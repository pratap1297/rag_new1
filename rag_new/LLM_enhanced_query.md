Excellent point! You want a generic, LLM-powered solution that can handle any entity type without hardcoding. Here's a comprehensive approach:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Generic LLM-Powered Query Decomposition & Synonym Resolution**

### 1. **Enhanced Query Analysis with LLM**

Create a new component in `fresh_conversation_nodes.py`:

```python
def _analyze_query_with_llm(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Use LLM to understand query structure and intent"""
    
    if not self.llm_client:
        return {"needs_decomposition": False}
    
    analysis_prompt = """Analyze this query and provide a structured response:
    Query: "{query}"
    
    Respond in JSON format:
    {{
        "query_type": "single" or "multi" or "aggregation",
        "needs_decomposition": true/false,
        "entity_type": "what is being asked about (e.g., 'AP models', 'incidents', 'employees')",
        "scope": "specific" or "all" or "multiple",
        "scope_targets": ["list of specific targets if scope is specific, e.g., 'Building A'"],
        "action": "list" or "count" or "find" or "compare",
        "filters": {{"any filters mentioned": "value"}},
        "decomposed_queries": ["if needs_decomposition, list simpler queries"],
        "search_keywords": ["key terms to search for"],
        "synonyms": {{"term": ["synonym1", "synonym2"]}}
    }}
    
    Examples:
    - "List all AP models in all buildings" â†’ needs decomposition into queries for each building
    - "How many incidents in December" â†’ aggregation query with time filter
    - "Show me all network devices across all locations" â†’ multi-entity query needing synonym expansion
    """.format(query=query)
    
    try:
        response = self.llm_client.generate(analysis_prompt)
        return json.loads(response)
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"LLM analysis failed: {e}")
        return {"needs_decomposition": False}
```

### 2. **Generic Entity Detection & Synonym Expansion**

Add to `fresh_smart_router.py`:

```python
class SmartQueryAnalyzer:
    """Advanced query analysis with LLM support"""
    
    def __init__(self, llm_client=None):
        self.llm_client = llm_client
        
    def analyze_entities_and_scope(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract entities and scope using LLM"""
        
        prompt = """Extract entities and scope from this query. Be generic and identify patterns.
        
        Query: "{query}"
        
        Identify:
        1. Entity type (what kind of thing: device, location, document, person, etc.)
        2. Specific instances mentioned (Building A, Floor 2, John Doe, etc.)
        3. Scope indicators (all, every, each, specific, between X and Y)
        4. Synonyms that might be needed
        
        Return JSON:
        {{
            "primary_entity": "main thing being asked about",
            "entity_instances": ["specific instances mentioned"],
            "scope": "all" or "specific" or "range",
            "potential_synonyms": {{
                "entity": ["synonym1", "synonym2"],
                "instance": ["alternate names"]
            }},
            "requires_multi_search": true/false
        }}
        """.format(query=query)
        
        try:
            response = self.llm_client.generate(prompt)
            return json.loads(response)
        except:
            # Fallback to pattern matching
            return self._fallback_entity_detection(query)
```

### 3. **Dynamic Query Decomposition**

In `fresh_conversation_nodes.py`, enhance the search method:

```python
def search_knowledge(self, state: FreshConversationState) -> FreshConversationState:
    """Execute search with LLM-powered decomposition"""
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Analyze query with LLM
    query_analysis = self._analyze_query_with_llm(processed_query)
    
    if query_analysis.get('needs_decomposition'):
        return self._handle_decomposed_search(state, query_analysis)
    
    if query_analysis.get('query_type') == 'aggregation':
        return self._handle_generic_aggregation(state, query_analysis)
    
    # Continue with normal search...

def _handle_decomposed_search(self, state: FreshConversationState, 
                             analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> FreshConversationState:
    """Handle queries that need to be broken down"""
    
    decomposed_queries = analysis.get('decomposed_queries', [])
    if not decomposed_queries:
        # LLM didn't provide decomposition, try to generate
        decomposed_queries = self._generate_query_decomposition(
            state['processed_query'],
            analysis
        )
    
    # Execute each sub-query
    all_results = []
    all_chunks = []
    results_by_query = {}
    
    for sub_query in decomposed_queries:
        # Apply synonym expansion
        expanded_query = self._expand_with_synonyms(sub_query, analysis.get('synonyms', {}))
        
        if self.query_engine:
            result = self.query_engine.process_query(
                expanded_query,
                conversation_context={}
            )
            
            if result and result.get('sources'):
                results_by_query[sub_query] = result['sources']
                all_results.extend(result['sources'])
                all_chunks.extend([s.get('text', '') for s in result['sources']])
    
    # Store structured results
    new_state = state.copy()
    new_state['search_results'] = all_results
    new_state['context_chunks'] = all_chunks
    new_state['decomposed_search'] = True
    new_state['search_structure'] = {
        'original_query': state['original_query'],
        'analysis': analysis,
        'results_by_query': results_by_query
    }
    
    return new_state

def _expand_with_synonyms(self, query: str, synonyms: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> str:
    """Expand query with synonyms for better matching"""
    
    expanded = query
    for term, synonym_list in synonyms.items():
        if term.lower() in query.lower():
            # Create OR expression
            synonym_expr = f"({term} OR {' OR '.join(synonym_list)})"
            expanded = expanded.replace(term, synonym_expr)
    
    return expanded
```

### 4. **Generic Aggregation with LLM Understanding**

```python
def _handle_generic_aggregation(self, state: FreshConversationState, 
                               analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> FreshConversationState:
    """Handle aggregation queries generically using LLM analysis"""
    
    entity_type = analysis.get('entity_type', '')
    filters = analysis.get('filters', {})
    
    # Use LLM to determine what to search for
    if self.llm_client and entity_type:
        search_prompt = f"""Given that user wants to count '{entity_type}', 
        what search terms should I use to find these in documents?
        Provide a JSON array of search terms and patterns.
        
        Example: For "AP models" -> ["AP", "access point", "Cisco3802", "Cisco1562"]
        For "incidents" -> ["INC", "incident", "INCIDENT"]
        """
        
        try:
            search_terms = json.loads(self.llm_client.generate(search_prompt))
        except:
            search_terms = [entity_type]
    else:
        search_terms = [entity_type]
    
    # Execute count with dynamic search terms
    total_count = 0
    if self.query_engine and hasattr(self.query_engine, 'count_documents'):
        for term in search_terms:
            count = self.query_engine.count_documents(
                query=term,
                filters=filters
            )
            total_count += count
    
    # Build result description
    filter_desc = ""
    if filters:
        filter_desc = " with filters: " + ", ".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in filters.items()])
    
    new_state = state.copy()
    new_state['aggregation_result'] = {
        'type': entity_type + filter_desc,
        'count': total_count,
        'search_terms_used': search_terms
    }
    
    return new_state
```

### 5. **Intelligent Response Generation**

```python
def generate_response(self, state: FreshConversationState) -> FreshConversationState:
    """Generate response with awareness of query structure"""
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Handle decomposed searches
    if state.get('decomposed_search'):
        response = self._generate_structured_response(state)
        return self._add_response_to_state(new_state, response)

def _generate_structured_response(self, state: FreshConversationState) -> str:
    """Generate response for decomposed/structured queries"""
    
    search_structure = state.get('search_structure', {})
    analysis = search_structure.get('analysis', {})
    results_by_query = search_structure.get('results_by_query', {})
    
    if not self.llm_client:
        # Fallback formatting
        return self._format_structured_results_fallback(results_by_query)
    
    # Use LLM to synthesize results
    synthesis_prompt = f"""Synthesize these search results into a comprehensive answer.
    
    Original query: {search_structure.get('original_query')}
    Query type: {analysis.get('query_type')}
    Entity type: {analysis.get('entity_type')}
    
    Results by sub-query:
    {json.dumps(results_by_query, indent=2)}
    
    Provide a well-structured response that:
    1. Directly answers the original query
    2. Organizes information logically
    3. Highlights patterns or commonalities
    4. Notes any gaps or missing information
    """
    
    try:
        response = self.llm_client.generate(synthesis_prompt)
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"LLM synthesis failed: {e}")
        return self._format_structured_results_fallback(results_by_query)
```

### 6. **Example: How It Works**

For query: **"List all the AP model installed in all buildings"**

```json
LLM Analysis:
{
    "query_type": "multi",
    "needs_decomposition": true,
    "entity_type": "AP models",
    "scope": "all",
    "scope_targets": ["all buildings"],
    "action": "list",
    "decomposed_queries": [
        "AP models in Building A",
        "AP models in Building B",
        "AP models in Building C"
    ],
    "synonyms": {
        "AP": ["access point", "wireless AP", "WiFi AP"],
        "model": ["type", "version", "model number"]
    }
}
```

The system then:
1. Executes each decomposed query with synonym expansion
2. Aggregates results
3. Uses LLM to synthesize a comprehensive response

### 7. **Configuration**

Add to your config:

```python
# In FreshConversationNodes.__init__
self.enable_llm_query_analysis = True
self.max_decomposed_queries = 10
self.synonym_expansion_enabled = True
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

1. **No hardcoding** - Works for any entity type
2. **Synonym awareness** - "AP" = "access point" = "wireless AP"
3. **Smart decomposition** - Breaks complex queries appropriately
4. **Context-aware** - Understands "all buildings" vs "Building A"
5. **Extensible** - LLM learns from your data patterns

This approach makes your system truly generic and intelligent!
