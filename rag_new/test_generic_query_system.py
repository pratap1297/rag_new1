üéØ THE SYSTEM DOESN'T NEED TO BE "FED" SCENARIOS BECAUSE:

1. **LLM-Powered Analysis**: 
   - The LLM can understand ANY query in natural language
   - It doesn't need pre-programmed entity types
   - It can analyze queries from any domain (technical, business, random)

2. **Pattern-Based Fallback**:
   - If LLM fails, regex patterns detect common structures
   - Patterns work for ANY entity type (names, IDs, locations, etc.)
   - No hardcoded domain knowledge required

3. **Generic Query Structure**:
   - System looks for: WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHEN/HOW patterns
   - Detects: single/multi/aggregation query types
   - Identifies: scope (specific/all/multiple) automatically

4. **Adaptive Entity Detection**:
   - Automatically detects: person names, locations, devices, etc.
   - Uses linguistic patterns, not hardcoded lists
   - Extracts identifiers from any domain

5. **Flexible Response Generation**:
   - Adapts response format based on detected entity type
   - Uses generic templates that work for any domain
   - Provides structured output regardless of query type

üöÄ EXAMPLES OF GENERIC HANDLING:

Query: "Who is Marie Curie?"
‚Üí Detects: person entity, formats person response

Query: "List all endangered species in Africa"  
‚Üí Detects: aggregation query, decomposes by region

Query: "What is the capital of Mars?"
‚Üí Detects: location query, searches for Mars information

Query: "How many quantum computers exist?"
‚Üí Detects: count query, searches for quantum computer data

üéØ THE SYSTEM IS TRULY GENERIC BECAUSE:
- It analyzes the STRUCTURE of language, not specific content
- It uses AI to understand intent, not hardcoded rules
- It adapts to any domain without modification
- It provides consistent handling regardless of topic
