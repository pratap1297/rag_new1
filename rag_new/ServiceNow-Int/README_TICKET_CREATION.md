# ServiceNow Warehouse Network Ticket Generator

This directory contains scripts to generate realistic network incident tickets for Cisco routers in warehouse environments and push them to ServiceNow.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### Core Scripts
- **`create_sample_tickets.py`** - Main script to create actual ServiceNow tickets (requires credentials)
- **`servicenow_connector.py`** - ServiceNow API connector class
- **`demo_ticket_creation.py`** - Demo script that shows what tickets would be created (no credentials needed)

### Configuration
- **`.env`** (root directory) - Environment variables for ServiceNow credentials

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Demo Mode (No ServiceNow Access Required)
```bash
python demo_ticket_creation.py
```
This will show you exactly what tickets would be created without requiring ServiceNow credentials.

### Option 2: Create Actual ServiceNow Tickets
1. Configure your ServiceNow credentials in the root `.env` file
2. Run the ticket creation script:
```bash
python create_sample_tickets.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### ServiceNow Credentials
Add these variables to your root `.env` file:

```env
# ServiceNow Configuration
SERVICENOW_INSTANCE=your-instance-name
SERVICENOW_USERNAME=your-username
SERVICENOW_PASSWORD=your-password
```

**Instance Format Options:**
- `your-company` (will become `https://your-company.service-now.com`)
- `your-company.service-now.com` (will become `https://your-company.service-now.com`)
- `https://your-company.service-now.com` (used as-is)

## üìä Priority Distribution

The scripts generate tickets with realistic priority distribution:

| Priority | Label | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Critical | 25% | Complete operations shutdown, >$10K/hour impact |
| 2 | High | 37.5% | Significant operational impact, multiple systems affected |
| 3 | Moderate | 25% | Partial service degradation, workarounds available |
| 4 | Low | 12.5% | Minor impact, normal operations continue |

## üéØ Sample Ticket Structure

Each generated ticket includes:

### Basic Information
- **Short Description**: Brief issue summary with equipment and location
- **Priority**: 1-4 (Critical to Low)
- **Category**: Network > Router
- **State**: New (1)
- **Assignment Group**: Network Operations

### Detailed Information
- **Location**: Specific warehouse facility
- **CMDB CI**: Router hostname (e.g., WH-RTR-CEN-28)
- **Business Service**: Warehouse Operations

### Comprehensive Description
- **Incident Summary**: Overview of the network issue
- **Affected Equipment**: Device details, hostname, IP, location
- **Business Impact**: Specific operational consequences
- **Symptoms Observed**: Technical symptoms experienced
- **Troubleshooting Performed**: Initial diagnostic steps taken
- **Priority Justification**: Reason for assigned priority level

## üîß Usage Examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **Verify credentials** in `.env` file
2. **Check instance URL** format
3. **Test connectivity** to ServiceNow instance
4. **Verify user permissions** for incident creation

### Common Errors
- **Missing credentials**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
- **Invalid instance**: Check ServiceNow instance name/URL format
- **Permission denied**: Verify user has incident creation permissions
- **Network timeout**: Check firewall/proxy settings

### Testing Connection
```bash
python servicenow_connector.py
```
This will test your ServiceNow connection and show recent incidents.

## üîê Security Notes

- Store credentials securely in `.env` file
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Consider using OAuth for production environments

## üìà Integration with Router Rescue AI

These tickets are designed to integrate with the Router Rescue AI system:

1. **Network Keywords**: Tickets include router, switch, network, BGP, OSPF terms
2. **Cisco Equipment**: Focus on Cisco router models commonly used in warehouses  
3. **Technical Details**: Include specific network troubleshooting information
4. **Business Context**: Warehouse-specific operational impacts

The ServiceNow scheduler (`servicenow_scheduler.py`) can automatically fetch these tickets and process them through the Router Rescue AI backend for intelligent analysis and recommendations.
