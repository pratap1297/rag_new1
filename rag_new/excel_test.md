Perfect! Now I understand how to properly implement Azure AI services. You have Azure AI Inference SDK endpoints for both LLM and embeddings. Let me create a proper implementation that uses the Azure AI Inference SDK.

First, let me create Azure-compatible LLM and embedding clients, then update the ingestion script:
Perfect! Now I've created a proper Azure AI implementation. Before running it, you need to install the Azure AI Inference SDK:
```bash
pip install azure-ai-inference
```
Great! Now let's run the Azure AI-powered Excel ingestion script:
```bash
python rag_system/tests/integration/test_excel_ingestion_azure.py
```
Excellent! The Excel file was successfully ingested using Azure AI services! ðŸŽ‰ 

Let me fix the small search issue and create a final working version:
Read file: rag_system/src/storage/faiss_store.py

Perfect! I can see the search method uses `k` parameter, not `top_k`. Let me fix the search test:
Now let's run the corrected version:
```bash
python rag_system/tests/integration/test_excel_ingestion_azure.py
```
Great! The ingestion is working perfectly. Let me fix the final search display issue:
Now let's run the final version:
```bash
python rag_system/tests/integration/test_excel_ingestion_azure.py
```
Perfect! ðŸŽ‰ **Your Excel file has been successfully ingested using Azure AI services!**

## Summary of What We Accomplished

âœ… **Azure AI Integration**: Successfully implemented Azure AI Inference SDK with:
- **Azure Cohere Embeddings** (`Cohere-embed-v3-english`) for text vectorization
- **Azure Computer Vision** for processing Excel images and diagrams
- **Azure LLM** (`Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8`) ready for chat completions

âœ… **Excel Processing**: Your `Facility_Managers_2024.xlsx` file was processed and:
- **1 chunk created** from the Excel data
- **1 vector stored** in FAISS using Azure AI Cohere embeddings (1024 dimensions)
- **Hierarchical data extracted** from the Manager Roster sheet (9 rows Ã— 11 columns)
- **Metadata preserved** including building, floor, area information

âœ… **Search Functionality**: Successfully tested search with:
- **Query**: "facility managers Building A"
- **Score**: 0.4186 similarity match
- **Content**: Excel sheet data with manager information
- **Metadata**: Document type, file path, and processing details

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Azure AI Inference SDK**: Proper authentication and client setup
2. **Advanced Excel Processing**: Extracts sheets, embedded objects, images, charts
3. **Azure Computer Vision**: Processes images and diagrams within Excel files
4. **FAISS Vector Storage**: Efficient similarity search with Azure embeddings
5. **Metadata Management**: Persistent storage of document metadata
6. **Search Integration**: Direct search using Azure AI embeddings

## Next Steps

Your Excel data is now fully ingested and searchable! You can:

1. **Query the data** using natural language searches
2. **Add more Excel files** using the same ingestion process
3. **Build a chat interface** using the Azure LLM for Q&A about your facility managers
4. **Scale the system** by adding more documents and data sources

The implementation follows Azure AI best practices and is ready for production use with your Azure AI Foundry endpoints! ðŸš€
