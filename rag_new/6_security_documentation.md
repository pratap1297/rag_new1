## Security Documentation: RAG System

This document outlines the security considerations and measures implemented within the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System. It covers aspects of data security, access control, secure communication, and operational security.

### 1. Data Security

#### 1.1. Data at Rest

*   **Vector Store (FAISS/Qdrant)**:
    *   **FAISS**: When deployed locally, FAISS indexes are stored as files (`.faiss`, `.pkl`). These files should reside on encrypted file systems (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, LUKS for Linux, or cloud-provider managed disk encryption like AWS EBS encryption, Azure Disk Encryption).
    *   **Qdrant**: Qdrant supports on-disk storage and can be configured to use encrypted volumes provided by the underlying infrastructure. Data within Qdrant itself is stored in a structured format.
*   **Metadata Store (JSON Files)**:
    *   Metadata is stored in plain JSON files (`.json`). These files contain sensitive information about documents and chunks. They **must** be stored on encrypted file systems.
*   **Feedback Store (SQLite)**:
    *   User feedback is stored in an SQLite database file (`.db`). This file should also be protected by file system encryption.
*   **Logs**: Log files (`.log`, `.json`) may contain sensitive operational data. They should be stored on encrypted volumes and access restricted.

#### 1.2. Data in Transit

*   **API Communication**: All communication with the FastAPI API Service should be encrypted using **HTTPS/TLS**. This protects data exchanged between the user interface/client applications and the backend.
*   **Internal Service Communication**: Communication between RAG components (e.g., API to Qdrant, RAG Core to LLM Service) should ideally occur over secure, private networks (e.g., within a Virtual Private Cloud/Network) and be encrypted using TLS where possible.
*   **External API Calls**: Calls to external services (e.g., LLM providers like OpenAI, Groq, Azure AI Services, ServiceNow, Power BI) are made over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication channels.

### 2. Access Control and Authentication

#### 2.1. API Access Control

*   **Authentication**: The provided FastAPI application does not include built-in user authentication/authorization. For production deployments, it is **critical** to implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT, API Keys) to protect API endpoints.
    *   **Recommendation**: Integrate with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Azure Active Directory, Okta, or Auth0.
*   **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints (e.g., `/manage`, `/clear`, `/upload`) to authorized users or roles only.

#### 2.2. Service Account Credentials

*   **LLM API Keys**: API keys for LLM providers (Groq, OpenAI, Azure) are sensitive credentials. They are loaded from environment variables (`.env` file) and should **never** be hardcoded in the application code.
    *   **Secure Storage**: In production, environment variables should be managed securely using secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault).
*   **Azure AI Service Keys**: Keys for Azure Computer Vision and Document Intelligence are also sensitive and should be managed as secrets.
*   **ServiceNow/Power BI Credentials**: Usernames, passwords, or API tokens for integration with ServiceNow and Power BI are sensitive and must be securely stored and accessed.

#### 2.3. Infrastructure Access

*   **Least Privilege**: Access to the underlying infrastructure (servers, containers, databases) hosting the RAG system should adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only necessary ports should be open, and access should be restricted to authorized personnel.
*   **Network Segmentation**: Deploy the RAG system components within a private network segment (e.g., VPC subnet) and use network security groups or firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **API Input Validation**: FastAPI models (`pydantic`) are used to validate incoming API requests, ensuring data types and formats are correct. This helps prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection (though not directly applicable to vector stores, it's a good practice) and cross-site scripting (XSS) in text fields.
*   **File Uploads**: File uploads are handled carefully, with checks for file size and supported formats to prevent denial-of-service attacks or the upload of malicious executables.
*   **Query Sanitization**: While LLMs are generally robust, it's good practice to sanitize user queries to remove potentially harmful inputs before processing, especially if queries are directly used in shell commands or database interactions (not currently the case in this RAG system).

### 4. Logging and Monitoring

*   **Centralized Logging**: The system uses a centralized logging configuration (`rag_system/src/core/logging_config.py`) that can output structured JSON logs. These logs should be collected by a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for security monitoring and incident detection.
*   **Sensitive Data Masking**: Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., API keys, personal identifiable information) is not logged in plain text. Implement masking or redaction where necessary.
*   **Heartbeat Monitoring**: The `HeartbeatMonitor` (`rag_system/src/monitoring/heartbeat_monitor.py`) provides continuous health checks, alerting administrators to unusual behavior or component failures that might indicate a security incident.
*   **Error Tracking**: The unified error handling system (`rag_system/src/core/unified_error_handling.py`) tracks and logs errors, which can be crucial for identifying and responding to attacks or system anomalies.

### 5. Secure Development Practices

*   **Dependency Management**: Regularly update third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `pip-audit` or `Snyk` to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Code Review**: Implement a rigorous code review process to identify security flaws and ensure adherence to secure coding guidelines.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Design components and configure permissions with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: As mentioned, all sensitive credentials should be loaded from environment variables or a secrets management system.

### 6. Operational Security

*   **Regular Backups**: Implement a robust backup strategy for the vector store and metadata store to ensure data recovery in case of data corruption or loss due to security incidents.
*   **Disaster Recovery**: Have a well-defined disaster recovery plan to restore services quickly after a major security event.
*   **Incident Response**: Establish an incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests against the deployed system to identify and remediate security weaknesses.

### 7. Compliance

*   Depending on the data processed and the industry, ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). This may involve specific data handling, encryption, and auditing requirements.
