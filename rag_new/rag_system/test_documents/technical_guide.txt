TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: RAG SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

INTRODUCTION
============
This document provides technical specifications for implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using modern AI technologies. The system combines vector databases, embedding models, and large language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

SYSTEM COMPONENTS
=================

Vector Database
---------------
The system uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector storage and retrieval:
- Index Type: IndexFlatIP (Inner Product)
- Dimension: 384 (for sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Storage: Persistent disk storage with backup capabilities
- Performance: Sub-millisecond search for datasets up to 1M vectors

Embedding Model
---------------
Primary embedding model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Model Size: 22.7MB
- Embedding Dimension: 384
- Max Sequence Length: 256 tokens
- Performance: ~2000 sentences/second on CPU
- Use Case: General-purpose semantic similarity

Alternative models for specialized use cases:
- all-mpnet-base-v2: Higher quality, slower performance
- all-distilroberta-v1: Balanced speed and quality
- multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1: Optimized for question-answering

- gemma-7b-it: Efficient for general tasks

OpenAI:
- gpt-3.5-turbo: Cost-effective, good performance
- gpt-4: Highest quality, slower and more expensive
